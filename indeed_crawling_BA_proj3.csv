We have a team of highly skilled technology and finance professionals, and are currently looking for highly motivated field experts to be part of our high-energy team.

Where did it all start:
Our journey started in 2010, when Raghu Kumar (RK), Ravi Kumar (RK) and Shrinivas Viswanath (SV) founded RKSV Securities India Pvt. Ltd., a proprietary trading firm. In 2012, we opened up to the general public by entering the retail brokerage space as a discount-broking firm. The dream was to make stock-market investing affordable and easy for all Indians, while ensuring that they also made profits from the venture. In 2016, we rebranded ourselves as Upstox. The same year, we also raised about $4 million in the first round of funding, backed by Mr. Ratan Tata, Kalaari Capital, and GVK Davix.
