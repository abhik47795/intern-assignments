We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.
We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we’re now looking to add experienced Data Science Developers to our team in Pune.
You have hands-on experience using AI frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras in a work setting. You have at least a couple of years of work experience using Python/R. You’ve used multiple classification models and Pandas, Numpy, Matlab etc. You are proficient at using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc. You have a track record of demonstrated success in business problem solving. Data visualization experience is a plus.
You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the data science world and know the differences between classification, regression, clustering and time series. You know the limitations of each algorithm. You are motivated to learn new technologies.
That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:
Who we are:
We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.
We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.
Who you’ll be working with:
We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote teams. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.
You’ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he’s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You’ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.
Your work environment:
We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.
We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.
Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on fancy office space.
Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.
We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.
Your skills:
You keep up with technology changes and trends
You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them
You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs
You are skilled at development with Python/R and using Ai frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras
Proficient in the use of Pandas, Numpy, Matlib, MatPlotlib and commonly used libraries
You understand ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, XgBoost etc thoroughly
You are quick to understand business problems and understand how to classify problems that exist in large datasets
Any data visualization experience is a plus as is any background in statistics
You have developed, implemented and supported a ML application successfully at work
