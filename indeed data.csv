Climate Connect Ltd. applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) forecasting techniques such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosting, to a range of opportunities within the evolving energy ecosystem. Climate Connect was founded in 2010 by Cambridge University alumni, after rapid growth the young company now has a team of 40+ people spread across 3 main locations: Delhi (India), Pune (India), Amsterdam (NL). We also run a carbon market intelligence platform, CaliforniaCarbon.info, and so have strong business interests and are firmly embedded in the energy networks on the US West Coast.
We build forecasting and optimisation software for renewable energy and storage technologies to enable asset owners to see greater returns from their investments. This may be achieved through smart analytics to improve operational efficiency; dynamic forecast to reduce the costs of variable production; or when aligned with our proprietary price forecasting, increase revenue by selling directly though to markets. As such, we recruit across a range of different skill sets: engineers, software developers, pure mathematicians, meteorologists, economists, and those with a commercial understanding of energy markets.
In sum, we build software that removes middle-men within the current energy paradigm, and returns value to the owners of generative and distributive capacity. Across almost every sector: transport, housing, even food, AI is having a revolutionary and localising effect, Climate Connect is at the epicentre of this transformation in energy.
